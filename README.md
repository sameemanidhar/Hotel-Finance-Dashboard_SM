# Hotel-Finance-Dashboard_SM
The Hotel Finance Dashboard is a data-driven tool focused on understanding trends in financial revenue within the KROWN Hotels Group. This interactive dashboard provides functionality for navigating finance and enables the stakeholders to optimize their revenue and customer retention strategies efficiently. The dashboard breaks down crucial data-driven insights and presents a call to action based on these insights. 

## Objective
The primary objective is to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive financial performance overview, an in-depth report of the data, and potential recommendations. Visualizing the sales data through a dashboard enhances decision-making and strategic planning by giving crucial insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and product performance.

## Dataset
The dataset comprises hotel data with crucial booking details like market segment, adr, customer information, lead times, and cancelations. Other dependencies include distribution channel, hotel type, and expenses. The dataset was initially part of a revenue tracker in KROWN Hotel's database updated daily. Then the dataset was imported to SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to calculate KPIs and perform data transformation. The database server was then connected to Power BI to clean and transform. The structural procedure was automated with a daily recurring job task, allowing it to integrate into a fully functional automated real-time dashboard.
